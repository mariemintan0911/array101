In array 101, example 1
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
thought process:
1. its oop
2. need find a way to tell it starts counting
3. need find a way to store the 'max' number of 1, until there is a new set of consecutive 1s thats >
4.find a way to replace in 3
5.when to stop
